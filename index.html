      <h2>Facts about Dogs!</h2>
      <p>I love dogs! I used to walk and take care of them over the summer through an app called Wag!</p>
      <p>Here are three dogs I have taken care of:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The Australian Shepherd, often referred to as the Aussie Shepherd, is a medium-sized breed of dog developed in the United States, despite its name. Koda is a 2-year-old  energetic dog who loves to play fetch, knows tricks such as "sit," "paw," and "roll", and enjoys a lot of cuddles. </p>

          <figcaption>Penny, a Dachshund</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> The dachshund is usually short, but long-bodies, with short legs. “Dachshund” is a German word that means “badger dog.” Penny is a 14-yeard old lady who loves belly rubs and her treats. She struggles to walk but enjoys her long naps.</p>

          <figcaption>Niles, a Yorkie</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The Yorkshire Terrier, or Yorkie, is a small breed of terrier dog originating from Rorkshire, United Kingdom which is where it gets its name. Niles is a 4-year-old puppy with alot of energy who tries to chase squirrels on every walk. For some reason, he hates and barks at bikes, motorcycles, and buses.</p>
